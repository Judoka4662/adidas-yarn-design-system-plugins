# adidas YARN Design System plugins

Monorepository to manage all the adidas **YARN** Design System plugins for adidas only use.

Each plugin extends [adidas **YARN** Design System library][yarn-library] by adding the plugin main class as part of `.yarn` main class.

The available plugins are shown on the [**documentation page**][adidas-yarn-design-system-plugins-documentation].

## Use cases

The idea of the plugins is to add customizations for either third party libraries or non core components directly in **YARN** source code.

## Requirements and dependencies

This repository contains different plugins which are independent packages. It means that all these packages are published independently but managed all together. [Lerna][lerna] is the tool used to manage them.

[NodeJS/NPM][nodejs] are required to work with the repository.

## Installation and running

Install a specific package in production mode (installation of each configuration):

```
npm install PACKAGE_NAME[@VERSION]
```

The required dependencies of each package are listed in their own `package.json` file as either dependency or peer dependency.

Specific instructions about how to use the configurations are placed in the `README.md` file of each package.

## Development

### Installation

In development mode (dependencies of the main package):

```
npm install
npm run setup
```

### Build and lint

[Lerna][lerna] manages the scripts of the available packages all together:

- Build:
  ```
  npm run build
  ```
- Lint:
  ```
  npm run lint
  ```

_Note:_ all the packages must have these two scripts with their specific commands.

## Publish

[Lerna][lerna] is in charge of publishing the packages, it requires that every single package has to set the version accordingly.

```
npm run lerna:publish
```
