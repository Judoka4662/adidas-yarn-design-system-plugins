Documentation and examples of the available [adidas **YARN** Design System][yarn] plugins.

The idea of the plugins is not to add customizations for either third party libraries or non core components directly in **YARN** source code.

Each plugin extends [adidas YARN Design System library][yarn-library] by adding the plugin main class as part of `.yarn` main class.

The source code of all of them is placed in a mono repository: [@adidas/yarn-design-system-plugins][repository].
